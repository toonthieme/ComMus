<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My corpus focuses on the “27 Club,” a collective of influential
musicians whose lives tragically ended at the age of 27. This group
includes iconic figures such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim
Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse. I chose to analyse Spotify
playlists dedicated to these artists to explore a diverse array of
musical genres, from rock and blues to grunge and soul. My goal is to
delve into their unique styles, lyrical content, and the cultural
contexts of their times, aiming to uncover both the stark differences
and surprising similarities in their music.</p>
<p>In my project, I intend to reflect on the personal struggles,
artistic visions, and societal issues these artists addressed through
their music. By focusing on audio features like energy, valence, tempo,
danceability, and acousticness extracted from Spotify, I aim to dissect
the emotional and energetic dimensions of their tracks. A significant
part of my analysis involves examining how musical modes (Major
vs. Minor) correlate with the mood and intensity of their music,
offering insights into the emotional depth conveyed.</p>
<p>I’ve highlighted the importance of understanding each artist’s
stylistic evolution, the thematic continuity across varied genres, and
the profound emotional resonance in their music. Including both live
performances and studio recordings in my analysis might provide deeper
insights into their artistry and the raw emotions expressed in live
settings.</p>
<p>This corpus is not just a tribute to the talents and legacies of
these artists but also a comprehensive examination of their
contributions to music and culture. Through detailed analysis—comparing
energy and valence, exploring danceability versus acousticness, and
examining the impact of musical mode—I seek to offer a nuanced
understanding of the “27 Club” members’ enduring influence and the
complex tapestry of themes that define their work.</p>
<p>For now i have used the “This is ..” playlists for each club member,
so there are multiple songs. I still need to decide whether i am going
to focus on certain songs of these artists (and which ones those will
be).</p>

<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Jimi Hendrix, born James Marshall Hendrix on November 27, 1942, in
Seattle, Washington, remains one of the most influential and innovative
guitarists in the history of popular music. His approach to the electric
guitar was revolutionary and pioneering, expanding the instrument’s role
beyond traditional rhythms and melodies to include feedback, distortion,
and previously unexplored effects. Hendrix’s technique, characterized by
its fluidity, speed, and use of the wah-wah pedal, transformed the sound
of rock and roll and inspired countless musicians across various
genres.</p>
<p>Hendrix’s musical career, though meteoric and brief, left an
indelible mark on the music world. He rose to fame in the United States
after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, where his
audacious guitar playing and dramatic stage antics—such as setting his
guitar on fire—cemented his status as a guitar icon. This followed his
success in the United Kingdom with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, a trio
that produced seminal albums like “Are You Experienced,” “Axis: Bold as
Love,” and “Electric Ladyland.”</p>
<p>Hendrix’s music was a fusion of blues, rock, R&amp;B, and jazz,
showcasing his exceptional talent not only as a guitarist but also as a
songwriter and vocalist. His most famous songs, such as “Purple Haze,”
“Foxy Lady,” “The Wind Cries Mary,” and his rendition of “The
Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock in 1969, exemplify his innovative use
of the guitar and his profound impact on the sound of contemporary
music.</p>
<p>Tragically, Jimi Hendrix’s life and career were cut short when he
died on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27, joining the infamous “27
Club” of music and cultural figures who died at that age. Despite his
brief career, Hendrix’s legacy endures. He is celebrated for his
contributions to music, particularly his mastery of the electric guitar,
which continues to inspire generations of musicians and fans alike.
Hendrix was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
1992, a testament to his enduring influence and significance in the
world of music.</p>

<hr />
<p>The chromagram for “All Along the Watchtower” reveals a dense and
continuous distribution of energy across a wide range of pitches. This
suggests a complex texture and a full harmonic structure, which is
characteristic of the rich instrumentation typically found in Jimi
Hendrix’s arrangements. The brighter areas indicate the parts of the
track where certain notes are played with higher intensity, possibly
during the song’s iconic solos or the full-bodied chorus sections. The
distribution of energy also reflects the song’s dynamic progression,
with peaks that likely correspond to the climactic points of the
track.</p>
<p>In the “Little Wing” chromagram, the energy is distributed more
sporadically, with clear bursts of brightness. These bursts correspond
to moments where specific notes are struck with more force or emphasis,
which align with the expressive, nuanced phrasing of Hendrix’s guitar
work. The song is known for its emotive guitar playing, and the
chromagram captures the ebb and flow of this energy. The variation in
color intensity suggests that “Little Wing” has a softer dynamic
overall, but with moments of increased intensity that give the song its
emotional impact.</p>
<p>The chromagram of “Purple Haze” is marked by areas of high intensity
that are more evenly spread out in time, but with a particular
concentration on specific pitches. These areas of intensity often
represent the song’s driving riffs and the anchoring motifs that Hendrix
repeats with variations throughout the track. The song’s aggressive and
upfront style is reflected in the sustained levels of energy in these
pitch classes, and the less intense areas likely represent the more
subdued vocal sections or breaks between the riffs.</p>
<p>General Observation:</p>
<p>Analyzing the chromagrams of these three songs, we can draw out a
common theme of dynamic range and expressiveness, attributes that define
Hendrix’s musical style. Each chromagram captures the signature
fluctuations in intensity that Hendrix brought to his music, whether
through his vigorous solos or the subtle nuances of his rhythm playing.
The visualization through chromagrams highlights the intricate balance
between melody and harmony in his work, showcasing how Hendrix
manipulated pitch and dynamics to craft his unique sound. These
graphical representations provide a window into the structural and
emotional framework of his music, illustrating how Hendrix’s approach to
the guitar transcended traditional playing to create a rich,
multisensory experience.</p>

<p>The Fourier-based tempogram provides a layered rhythmic analysis of
Jimi Hendrix’s “All Along the Watchtower,” indicating an average tempo
of 200 BPM as per Spotify’s API. However, this figure contrasts sharply
with the track’s perceived tempo upon listening and the widely reported
tempo of 113 BPM found in various online sources. The discrepancy
suggests that the 200 BPM could be a result of the tempogram capturing
harmonic rhythm or double-time elements rather than the pulse typically
felt by listeners. The tempogram reveals the intricacies of “tempo
octaves,” with stronger and weaker beats depicted through color
intensity, particularly in Hendrix’s free-form sections where precise
tempo measurement becomes complex. This contrast invites a deeper
exploration of the song’s tempo, considering the possibility of
misinterpretation by automated analysis when faced with the fluidity and
nuance of human musical expression.</p>

<h1 class="storyboard">Kurt Cobain</h1>
<div id="about-the-artist-1" class="section level3">
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Kurt Cobain, the lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of
Nirvana, remains one of the most iconic figures in the history of rock
music. Born on February 20, 1967, in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain’s
influence extended far beyond his music, touching on the culture,
fashion, and attitudes of an entire generation. Nirvana, formed in 1987,
became the flagship band of Generation X and is credited with bringing
grunge music to the mainstream with their seminal album, “Nevermind,”
released in 1991.</p>
<p>Cobain’s songwriting was known for its raw emotion, powerful
dynamics, and reflective lyrics that delved into personal pain, social
alienation, and a disdain for the superficiality of society. Tracks like
“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” “Come as You Are,” and “Heart-Shaped Box”
showcased his ability to blend melodic sensibilities with the raw power
of punk rock, creating anthems that resonated with a wide audience.</p>
<p>Despite achieving massive commercial success, Cobain was notoriously
uncomfortable with fame. He struggled with the expectations placed upon
him and was vocal about his issues with the music industry, media, and
the misinterpretation of his artistic vision. His personal life, marked
by his battle with heroin addiction and his tumultuous relationship with
Courtney Love, was heavily scrutinized by the public and media.</p>
<p>Kurt Cobain’s life came to a tragic end on April 5, 1994, when he
died by suicide at the age of 27. His death marked the end of an era and
left a void in the music world that is felt to this day. Cobain’s
influence on music and culture continues to be celebrated; he is
remembered not only for his contributions to grunge and alternative rock
but also for his impact on the ethos of a generation. Nirvana’s music
remains a powerful symbol of the 90s’ cultural landscape, embodying the
spirit of disillusionment and the quest for authenticity in a
commercialized world.</p>

<p>The chromagram for “Smells Like Teen Spirit” shows a dense
distribution of notes throughout the song, with frequent activity across
the range of pitches. The most prominent pitches appear to be around E
and F#, which are indicative of the song’s key and main power chords.
There’s a consistent pattern that repeats, reflecting the song’s iconic
guitar riff. The intensity of colors, particularly in the yellow and
green spectrum, suggests a strong presence and repetition of these notes
at a high magnitude, likely corresponding to the heavy, distorted guitar
that is central to the song’s sound. Throughout the timeline, there’s a
noticeable periodicity, corresponding to the song’s structure of verses
and choruses. The sections with less color could indicate quieter
moments, possibly the “clean” sections of the guitar riff or breaks
between the vocal phrases.</p>
<p>For “Come As You Are,” the chromagram shows a more concentrated
distribution of notes with a particular emphasis on D and E. This aligns
with the song’s memorable bassline which plays a critical role
throughout the track. The continuity of the colors suggests that the
song has a steady rhythmic and melodic pattern that does not deviate
much, indicative of the song’s hypnotic and persistent quality. The
colors are not as intense as in “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” which could
suggest less distortion or dynamic variation in the track. The
occasional spikes in magnitude, seen as brief bursts of yellow, could
represent the song’s chorus or more dynamically intense sections.</p>
<p>The chromagram for “About A Girl” shows a more varied and less dense
distribution of notes. There’s a visible alternation between pitches,
particularly around E, G, and A, which likely represents the song’s main
chord progression. The variation in color intensity suggests a dynamic
play between softer and louder sections, which is characteristic of the
song’s verse-chorus structure. There’s also a visible periodicity, but
with more variation than “Come As You Are,” implying a greater diversity
in the song’s sections. The less intense coloration compared to “Smells
Like Teen Spirit” could again suggest a lower level of distortion or a
more acoustic-driven sound.</p>
<p>Across all three Nirvana songs, there is a distinct pattern of
repetition and a strong presence of specific pitches that define each
song’s key characteristics. The chromagrams reflect the band’s grunge
style, with “Smells Like Teen Spirit” showing the most intense and dense
musical activity, which corresponds to its high-energy, distorted sound.
“Come As You Are” presents a more hypnotic and consistent pattern,
indicative of its more subdued yet persistent rhythm. “About A Girl”
demonstrates dynamic range and a clearer delineation between song
sections, suggesting a balance between softer verses and more powerful
choruses. Each chromagram visually encapsulates the essence of the song
it represents, displaying the distinctiveness of Nirvana’s musical
style, marked by memorable riffs, impactful dynamics, and a balance
between intensity and melody.</p>

<p>This keygram presents the harmonic analysis of Nirvana’s “Smells Like
Teen Spirit.” The vertical axis lists potential keys in both major and
minor, while the horizontal axis tracks the progression of the song over
time in seconds.</p>
<p>Observing the keygram, it’s clear that “Smells Like Teen Spirit”
predominantly resides in the key of F minor, as indicated by the
consistent dark blue color throughout the majority of the track. This
strong presence of F minor suggests that the song does not modulate
much, maintaining its key and thus contributing to the track’s gritty
and powerful sound—characteristics emblematic of the grunge genre.</p>
<p>As the song approaches its end, there’s a notable shift to a bright
yellow column, which could indicate a significant key change or a moment
where harmonic elements are less defined, perhaps during a guitar solo
or outro where traditional harmony may be suspended in favor of more
expressive or dissonant sounds.</p>
<p>The uniformity of the key throughout suggests a stable harmonic
structure, which is a common trait in rock music, often allowing the
melodic and rhythmic elements to drive the song’s energy and emotive
qualities.</p>

<p>Despite “Smells Like Teen Spirit” having a reported tempo of 117 BPM,
this tempogram suggests additional perceived tempo layers. Notably, a
prominent line can be seen around the 234 BPM mark. This might represent
the song’s double-time feel, which some listeners might perceive due to
the energetic drumming pattern or the rapid strumming of guitars. The
line is consistent and clear, which indicates a strong rhythmic element
at this faster tempo.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are also faint indications of tempo around the 117
BPM mark, aligning with the song’s actual tempo. However, these seem
less pronounced than the double-time tempo, which could be due to the
driving energy of the track that lends itself to a faster perceived
beat.</p>

<div id="about-the-artist-2" class="section level3">
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Janis Lyn Joplin, born on January 19, 1943, in Port Arthur, Texas,
remains one of the most powerful and influential figures in rock and
roll history. Her raw, explosive vocal style blended elements of blues,
rock, and soul, making her a pioneer of her time and earning her the
title of the “Queen of Psychedelic Soul.” Joplin’s brief but meteoric
career in the late 1960s reshaped the boundaries of music and
performance for women in the rock genre, leaving an indelible mark that
continues to inspire generations of musicians and fans alike.</p>
<p>Joplin’s journey to stardom began in her tumultuous teenage years,
marked by feelings of alienation and an intense passion for blues music.
This passion led her to the vibrant music scene of Austin, Texas, where
she first performed folk and blues music. However, it wasn’t until she
moved to San Francisco and joined the psychedelic rock band Big Brother
and the Holding Company that Joplin’s career truly took off. Their
performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, highlighted by
Joplin’s raw and emotionally charged rendition of “Ball and Chain,”
catapulted her to national fame.</p>
<p>Following her time with Big Brother, Joplin pursued a solo career
with her backing groups, first the Kozmic Blues Band and later the Full
Tilt Boogie Band. Her first solo effort, “I Got Dem Ol’ Kozmic Blues
Again Mama!” (1969), showcased a more soulful and bluesy sound. Yet, it
was her posthumously released album, “Pearl” (1971), that solidified her
legacy. Featuring hits like “Me and Bobby McGee” and “Mercedes Benz,”
“Pearl” exhibited Joplin’s diverse range and depth as a vocalist and
songwriter. Tragically, Joplin died of a heroin overdose at the age of
27, just a few weeks before “Pearl” was released.</p>
<p>Beyond her music, Janis Joplin is remembered for her distinctive
style, her unabashed expression of emotion, and her refusal to conform
to the expectations of women in the music industry and society at large.
She was known for her flamboyant, psychedelic wardrobe, her raspy,
soulful voice that seemed to carry the weight of her personal struggles,
and her electrifying stage presence that captivated audiences.</p>
<p>Joplin’s influence extends beyond her musical output; she is seen as
a symbol of the 1960s counterculture movement, a pioneer for women in
music, and a figure who challenged the norms of her time. Despite her
career’s brevity, Joplin’s contributions to music were profound, earning
her posthumous inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the
Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Her spirit and songs continue to
resonate, reminding us of the power of authenticity and the enduring
appeal of raw, heartfelt music. Janis Joplin’s legacy is not just in the
notes she sang but in the barriers she broke down, making the music
world a richer, more inclusive place.</p>

<p>The chromagram for “Me and Bobby McGee” shows a repeating pattern,
which likely corresponds to the song’s chorus and verses. The pitches
seem to be concentrated around C, D, and E, with occasional activity in
other pitches. This suggests a melody that revolves around these notes,
which is common for a song with a strong vocal line. The yellow and
green areas indicate sections of the song with higher intensity,
possibly when the chorus kicks in or during a powerful vocal part. There
is also a noticeable change in the pattern around the halfway mark,
which might correspond to a bridge or an instrumental solo where the
song’s dynamics change.</p>
<p>For “Piece of My Heart,” the chromagram shows a dense and varied
distribution of notes, with a lot of activity across the range of
pitches. This song is known for its raw vocal power and emotional
intensity, which could be reflected in the frequent changes in pitch and
intensity. There are several spikes of high magnitude throughout the
song, likely representing the powerful and emotive delivery that Janis
Joplin is famous for. The key notes seem to be around E, F#, and G,
which are consistently present throughout the track, suggesting these
are central to the song’s harmonic structure.</p>
<p>The chromagram for “Cry Baby” shows a somewhat less dense but still
varied pattern of notes. The distribution of pitches is less consistent
than in “Piece of My Heart,” with more sporadic bursts of color,
especially in the yellow range. This could be indicative of Joplin’s
dynamic vocal delivery, with sudden powerful outbursts. The pitches seem
to focus around E and F#, with some activity around C and D as well.
This may reflect a soulful melody that frequently moves between these
notes. The less consistent pattern could also suggest a song with a
significant amount of improvisation or variation in its vocal
delivery.</p>
<p>The chromagrams of Janis Joplin’s songs illustrate the dynamic and
soulful style of her music. The dense and varied distribution of notes
along with the frequent spikes in magnitude reflect her powerful vocal
performances and the emotional intensity of her songs. Each chromagram
shows a different pattern, which correlates to the unique structure and
delivery of each song. The chromagrams capture the essence of Joplin’s
music, with its raw energy, emotive power, and the central role of her
distinctive vocal style.</p>

<p>The range of colors from dark blue to light yellow indicates the
prevalence of certain keys at specific times. In the beginning, there is
a bright presence in G major, suggesting the song likely starts in this
key. The middle section of the song shows more variation in key
confidence, with transitions through several keys, reflecting either
actual modulations or possibly variations in instrumentation that
momentarily emphasize different tonalities.</p>
<p>The yellow streaks throughout indicate moments where the certainty of
the key is weaker, which could correlate with musical bridges, solos, or
more expressive vocal parts where the harmony becomes ambiguous. Towards
the end, there’s a return to the darker blues, particularly under G
major, suggesting a return to the song’s home key for a concluding verse
or chorus.</p>
<p>Overall, this keygram suggests that “Me and Bobby McGee” has a clear
tonal center with sections of harmonic diversity, creating a rich
musical tapestry that adds to the storytelling nature of the song.</p>

<p>Despite the song’s reported tempo of 93 BPM, the tempogram shows a
consistent line around the 186 BPM mark, which is exactly double the
reported tempo. This could suggest that while the song is perceived to
be at 93 BPM, the energy and rhythm may give a feel of a faster tempo,
possibly because of a double-time feel in the strumming or percussion
patterns.</p>
<p>The tempogram doesn’t show significant activity at the 93 BPM level,
which may be due to the way the song’s rhythm interacts with the

<h1 class="storyboard">Amy Winehouse</h1>
<div id="about-the-artist-3" class="section level3">
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Amy Winehouse was a British singer-songwriter known for her deep,
expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres
including soul, rhythm and blues, jazz, and reggae. Winehouse’s music
was a reflection of her personal experiences, and she was celebrated for
her candid songwriting and powerful performances that often felt like a
window into her soul.</p>
<p>Born on September 14, 1983, in London, Winehouse grew up in a family
with a love for jazz music, which deeply influenced her artistic
development. She attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School before
transferring to the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology.
Winehouse’s debut album, “Frank” (2003), was a critical success in the
UK and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The album’s title was a nod
to her admiration of Frank Sinatra and showcased her abilities not only
as a vocalist but also as a songwriter.</p>
<p>However, it was her second album, “Back to Black” (2006), that
catapulted her to international fame. The album, produced by Mark Ronson
and Salaam Remi, fused soul, jazz, and blues, and was distinguished by
its modern yet retro sound. “Back to Black” received widespread critical
acclaim and earned Winehouse numerous awards, including five Grammy
Awards, making her the first British woman to win five Grammys,
including three of the General Field “Big Four” Grammy Awards: Best New
Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year.</p>
<p>Winehouse’s music was notable for its emotional rawness and honesty.
Her lyrics often dealt with her personal life, including her tumultuous
relationships and struggles with substance abuse. Her signature song,
“Rehab,” became emblematic of her challenges, with its catchy yet
poignant refrain, “They tried to make me go to rehab, I said, ‘No, no,
no.’”</p>
<p>Despite her commercial success, Winehouse’s life was marked by
personal struggles. Her frequent battles with substance addiction and
mental health issues were heavily publicized in the media, often
overshadowing her musical achievements. Her distinctive style, featuring
a beehive hairdo and winged eyeliner, made her a muse for fashion
designers, but it was her unique voice and talent that left an indelible
mark on the music industry.</p>
<p>Winehouse’s death on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27, was a tragic
end to a career that was both influential and tumultuous. She became a
member of the so-called “27 Club,” a group of influential musicians who
died at the same age. Her legacy, however, endures through her music,
which continues to inspire a new generation of artists and music lovers
who resonate with her authenticity, artistry, and the timeless quality
of her voice and melodies.</p>
<p>Winehouse’s influence extended beyond music, with her life and career
having been the subject of various documentaries and retrospectives that
aim to understand the complexities of her life and the impact of her
work. Her posthumous album, “Lioness: Hidden Treasures” (2011), offered
a glimpse of her unreleased songs and demos, further solidifying her
status as a talented artist taken too soon. Amy Winehouse remains a
figure of fascination, remembered for her unmistakable voice, her
lyrical genius, and her contribution to modern music.</p>

<p>The chromagram for “Back to Black” exhibits a pronounced
concentration of energy in the lower pitch classes, which suggests a
song that is anchored in a lower register, perhaps indicative of a bass
line or lower-pitched chords that play a significant role in the song’s
harmonic structure. The relative consistency of energy across the track
may point towards a minimalistic arrangement that does not vary greatly
in terms of instrumentation or dynamics throughout the song. This could
correlate with the song’s somber mood and lyrical theme of mourning a
lost relationship. The repeating patterns visible in the chromagram
could be reflective of a recurring chord progression that is a hallmark
of the song’s structure, giving it a sense of cohesiveness and
predictability that may resonate with the themes of retrospection and
sorrow present in the lyrics.</p>
<p>In contrast, the chromagram for “Valerie” displays a broader
distribution of energy across the pitch classes, hinting at a more
complex harmonic composition. The patches of higher energy, represented
by the warmer colors, intermittently spread across the chromagram,
likely correspond to moments in the song where the instrumentation
becomes fuller or the vocal delivery more intense, such as during the
chorus or bridge. These moments of heightened energy could be capturing
the dynamic nature of the song, which, while still deeply emotional, has
an upbeat and soulful rhythm that makes it distinct from “Back to
Black.” The variance in the pattern of energy not only suggests changes
in the chord progression but also indicates the song’s potential for a
call-and-response style between the vocals and backing instruments, a
common feature in the soul genre to which this song pays homage.</p>
<p>The chromagram for “Rehab” shows a concentrated band of energy in the
mid to lower pitch classes with more distinct spikes in energy than
“Back to Black,” which could reflect a strong backbeat or a prominent
bass line that is characteristic of the song’s rhythm and blues
influence. The song has a defiant and gritty feel, mirrored in the
energy fluctuations that could represent the song’s bold brass sections
and the rhythmic emphasis that drives the track. The variations in the
energy pattern suggest a more complex musical structure than “Back to
Black,” with potential key changes or varied instrumental sections that
add to the song’s vigorous and rebellious spirit. The chromagram
captures the song’s dynamic shifts, which echo the narrative of personal
struggle and resistance in the face of external pressures, a central
theme of the lyrics.</p>
<p>Looking across all three songs, it’s evident that Amy Winehouse’s
music encompasses a range of emotional and harmonic complexity. The
chromagrams reflect not only the differences in mood and thematic
content between the songs but also the shared qualities that define her
musical style. Each song has its own distinctive pattern of energy
across the pitch classes, reflecting their unique chord progressions,
melodic lines, and overall arrangements. These visual patterns
underscore Winehouse’s ability to convey a wide array of emotions
through her music—from the melancholy of “Back to Black” to the spirited
soulfulness of “Valerie,” and the bold defiance of “Rehab.” The
chromagrams, in essence, offer a visual counterpart to the auditory
experience of Winehouse’s music, highlighting the depth and diversity of
her songwriting and compositional skills. Her songs manage to weave
intricate musical structures with emotionally charged performances,
creating a lasting impact that is both visually and sonically
apparent.</p>

to elements within the song that create a feel of faster tempo, like a
hi-hat played in double time or other percussive embellishments.</p>
<p>Scattered spots around 62 BPM may suggest instances where the rhythm
feels like it’s at half-time, emphasizing the moody and weighty

<div id="about-the-artist-4" class="section level3">
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Jim Morrison, the enigmatic frontman of The Doors, was an iconic
figure of the 1960s rock scene, known for his poetic lyrics, baritone
voice, and wild personality. Born on December 8, 1943, in Melbourne,
Florida, Morrison was not only a singer but also a poet, songwriter, and
filmmaker. His charisma and onstage persona made him one of the most
legendary and provocative figures in the history of rock music.</p>
<p>Morrison co-founded The Doors in 1965 in Los Angeles, California,
with keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John
Densmore. The band’s name was inspired by Aldous Huxley’s book “The
Doors of Perception,” which in turn was a reference to a William Blake
quotation: “If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would
appear to man as it is, infinite.”</p>
<p>The Doors quickly gained fame with hits like “Light My Fire,” “Break
On Through (To the Other Side),” and “The End,” showcasing Morrison’s
deep, bellowing voice and poetic lyrics. The band’s music was a fusion
of rock, blues, and psychedelia, and it often explored themes of death,
love, rebellion, and the human psyche. Morrison’s songwriting was
heavily influenced by literary figures such as Arthur Rimbaud, Friedrich
Nietzsche, and Jack Kerouac, and he was known for often improvising
spoken word passages during live performances.</p>
<p>Morrison’s public image was marked by a series of tumultuous events,
including on-stage arrests and his infamous indecency arrest in Miami,
which solidified his status as a counterculture icon. His unpredictable
behavior and substance abuse were a constant source of tension within
the band and with law enforcement, contributing to his mystique as well
as his eventual downfall.</p>
<p>Despite his troubled life, Morrison’s impact on rock music and
popular culture is undeniable. He was one of the earliest rock stars to
embody the archetype of the tortured artist, grappling with existential
angst and the burdens of fame. His lyrics and poetry are still studied
for their depth and intensity, and The Doors’ music remains influential,
covered and celebrated by artists across various genres.</p>
<p>Jim Morrison died in Paris on July 3, 1971, at the age of 27, under
circumstances that remain somewhat mysterious, adding to the mythos
surrounding his life and career. As with other members of the infamous
“27 Club,” his legacy has been romanticized and remains a subject of
fascination, symbolizing the rebellion and excesses of rock and roll.
Morrison’s grave at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is a pilgrimage site
for fans, and his spirit continues to captivate those who are drawn to
his artistry and the era he came to define.</p>

<p>The chromagram for “People Are Strange” reveals a varied distribution
of pitch classes with notable activity in the mid-range frequencies. The
song’s harmonic content appears to fluctuate, which may correspond to
its distinctive melody and changes in harmonic progression. There’s a
sense of unease and peculiarity, much like the song’s title and lyrics
suggest. The repeated patterns indicate a structured musical form but
with enough variation to keep the listener engaged. The chromagram shows
that the song does not rely heavily on the lower bass frequencies, which
might be indicative of a lighter instrumentation or a focus on mid-range
instruments like the guitar and the organ, consistent with the band’s
style.</p>
<p>“Riders on the Storm” presents a chromagram with a long duration, as
it is a longer track, and displays a relatively consistent pattern of
intensity across the pitch classes. This consistency might reflect the
song’s steady, driving beat that emulates the sound of a thunderstorm,
which is a central theme of the track. The energy seems to be spread
across both lower and higher pitch classes, suggesting a rich harmonic
texture that includes both bass and melodic elements. The extended
sections of similar coloration could indicate repetitive or hypnotic
sections within the song, aligning with its atmospheric and immersive
nature. There’s a sense of a journey, both musically and lyrically,
which is captured in the sustained energy throughout the piece.</p>
<p>For “Break on Through (To the Other Side),” the chromagram shows a
high concentration of energy in certain pitch classes at various points
throughout the song. These could be indicative of the song’s iconic,
punchy keyboard riffs and the strong, rhythmic bass lines that drive the
track forward. The intense bursts of color suggest a more energetic and
forceful composition, aligning with the song’s theme of breaking free
from constraints. The chromagram captures the essence of the song’s
dynamic shifts and the psychedelic rock influence with its sharp
contrasts in harmonic content.</p>
<p>The chromagrams for The Doors’ songs illustrate the band’s diverse
musical approach, with each track offering a different array of harmonic
complexities and emotional tones. “People Are Strange” shows the band’s
ability to weave an air of mystery and introspection into their music,
“Riders on the Storm” captures a more meditative and immersive
experience, and “Break on Through (To the Other Side)” reflects the
energy and rebellious spirit of the band. The chromatic visualization of
these songs underscores The Doors’ skill in balancing repetitive,
hypnotic elements with varied and intense musical moments to create
songs that are both catchy and deeply evocative. Each song’s chromagram,
therefore, provides a visual map of its musical journey, showcasing the
distinct and rich tapestry of sounds that define The Doors’ enduring
legacy in rock music.</p>

<p>The darker the color, the more prominent the key is at that moment in
the song. This keygram shows a strong presence in a few keys, with E
minor being quite dominant for a significant portion of the track, as
indicated by the dark blue color. E minor is often associated with a
melancholic and mysterious sound, which is fitting for the song’s title
and themes.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the song, there is a noticeable transition to
lighter colors, suggesting a possible key change or a section with less
defined tonality. This could correspond to a bridge or instrumental solo
that moves away from the main key, adding to the song’s dynamic and
enigmatic quality.</p>
<p>Overall, the keygram suggests that “People are Strange” has a rich
harmonic structure with a few key changes, enhancing the song’s
captivating and somewhat eerie mood.</p>

<p>The tempogram shows the tempo fluctuations for The Doors’ “People Are
Strange.” The horizontal axis represents time in seconds, covering the
song’s duration of 2 minutes and 10 seconds, while the vertical axis
represents tempo in BPM (beats per minute).</p>
<p>A visible line running horizontally around the 120 BPM range suggests
that the song’s primary tempo is maintained consistently throughout the
song, which aligns with the reported tempo of 119 BPM. The line’s
clarity throughout the tempogram indicates that this tempo is prominent
and steady, which supports the song’s danceable quality and time
signature of 4 beats per bar.</p>
<p>There doesn’t appear to be a strong presence at the 60 BPM range,
which would represent a half-time feel. Similarly, while the song can be
perceived at a double-time tempo of 238 BPM, the tempogram does not show
a distinct line at that level. This might be due to the song’s rhythmic
elements being more naturally aligned with the 119 BPM tempo.</p>
<p>The consistency of the main tempo line across the tempogram also
supports the song’s average energy level, providing a stable rhythmic
backbone that might be accentuated by the danceable groove of the track.
The minor key of E likely adds to the song’s unique atmosphere,
overlaying the steady rhythm with a distinctive melodic character.</p>

<p><strong>Major Key Histogram Story:</strong></p>
<p>In a colorful display of musical preference, the Histogram of Major
Keys charts a tale of harmony and style across the sonic landscapes
curated by five legendary artists. The bar for the key of C towers like
a lighthouse over the Hendrix playlist, signaling a fondness for the
pure and unadulterated sound that a major key rooted in C provides. This
preference sets Hendrix’s selections apart, revealing a possible
penchant for the bright and straightforward clarity that the key of C
offers in the realm of rock.</p>
<p>As we move through the chromatic spectrum, the key of G appears to
play a symphony of diversity, with almost equal representation across
all artists, suggesting it as a universal favorite - a key that
resonates with the strings of various musical souls.</p>
<p>The presence of the key of A# in the Joplin playlist is like a rare
flower in an eclectic garden, blooming brightly but infrequently,
hinting at a taste for the unconventional or perhaps a signature song
that frequents the playlist.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Key Histogram Story:</strong></p>
<p>Descending into the depths of the minor keys, the Histogram of Minor
Keys sings a ballad of introspection and emotional depth. The playlists
take on a more complex narrative where the key of C# underlines the
Nirvana playlist with a heavy stroke. This suggests an embrace of the
melancholic and introspective nature that minor keys often evoke,
possibly reflecting the grunge era’s gritty and raw aesthetic.</p>
<p>Joplin’s playlist, with a significant presence in the key of F,
whispers a story of soulful sorrow, a testament to bluesy influences and
earthy tones that minor keys carry with their flat thirds and
sevenths.</p>
<p>Morrison’s and Winehouse’s selections scatter across the keys,
suggesting a tapestry woven from a broad palette of moods and stories,
capturing the essence of their varied musical journeys.</p>
<p>Hendrix, while known for his electric major key riffs, also dips his
brush into the somber hues of minor keys, adding shades of complexity
and depth to his collection.</p>
<p>In summary, the major keys represent the artists’ brighter, more
vibrant selections, while the minor keys paint the playlists with
strokes of introspection and nuanced emotion. These histograms not only
showcase musical preferences but also act as windows into the artistic
souls of these musicians, with each bar a note in their larger musical
narrative.</p>

<p>The graph titled “Comparison of Time Signatures Across Playlists”
provides a visual narrative of rhythmic variety in the music collections
of Amy Winehouse, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt
Cobain.</p>
<p>In this story, the 4/4 time signature stands as the grand monolith—a
universal heartbeat in popular music, dominant and central to the
rhythmic structure of the songs across all the featured artists’
playlists. The bars in vibrant colors reaching upwards in a near-uniform
height for the 4/4 time signature signify its foundational role in
modern music, often considered the most common and accessible time
signature for listeners and musicians alike.</p>
<p>The absence of bars at the 0 and 2 markers indicates a
near-nonexistent use of more uncommon time signatures such as 1/4 or 2/4
in these collections, hinting at a shared stylistic choice for stability
and groove that a 4/4 time signature offers.</p>
<p>The solitary bars for Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain at the extreme
right tell tales of rare forays into less conventional time signatures,
perhaps a waltz with the unusual for artistic expression or simply an
outlier track that breaks from the norm.</p>
<p>This histogram doesn’t just compare counts; it underscores the
rhythmical consistency that underscores the oeuvre of these music
legends, illustrating how, despite their unique styles and voices, they
often built their songs upon the same temporal foundation—a testament to
the unifying power of the 4/4 time signature in the language of
music.</p>

<p>It’s a delightful surprise to unearth hidden connections in music
through data analysis. For instance, imagine telling a room full of rock
and soul enthusiasts that Nirvana’s grunge anthem ‘Smells Like Teen
Spirit’ is a data-doppelgänger to Amy Winehouse’s soulful
‘Valerie’—eyebrows would rise! Yet, when we delve into the numbers and
patterns within the music, this unlikely pairing emerges. It’s like
finding out that two radically different ingredients can create an
unexpectedly harmonious dish.</p>
<p>This clustering is particularly fascinating because it’s not
immediately evident when listening. The raw emotional punch of ‘Smiles
Like Teen Spirit’ and the poignant yet upbeat vibe of ‘Valerie’ seem
worlds apart. But beneath the surface, they share a skeleton of sonic
qualities that binds them in the analytical realm. It’s these subtleties
that might escape the casual listener but are captured in the meticulous
net of musical metrics.</p>
<p>Moreover, when we zoom out and see clusters of songs from different
artists snuggling up close together, it paints a picture of
genre-blurring camaraderie. Songs from Nirvana, Janis Joplin, The Doors,
and Amy Winehouse forming a mosaic of melodies, suggests that the
artists, often pigeonholed into distinct genres, have more in common
than genre labels would suggest. It’s an eloquent reminder of music’s
universal language, transcending perceived boundaries and uniting
diverse sounds under a single, harmonious roof.</p>
<p>Data reveals the threads that weave through music, connecting artists
and songs in a tapestry far more intricate than the binary of rock or
soul, grunge or blues. It’s an exquisite symphony of numbers and notes
where, against all odds, Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse share a silent
duet, nodding to the complexity and interconnectedness of musical
expression.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The corpus study on “The 27 Club” unravels a rich tapestry of
auditory brilliance that transcends the tragic narrative of artists
united by their premature departure at the age of 27. Through the
analytical lens of Spotify playlists, the study navigates the confluence
of Jimi Hendrix’s revolutionary guitar solos, Janis Joplin’s
soul-stirring vocal power, Jim Morrison’s poetic musicality, Kurt
Cobain’s raw grunge anthems, and Amy Winehouse’s emotive rhythm and
blues.</p>
<p>The chromatic and rhythmic analyses illuminate the distinctive
characteristics that each artist brought to the musical landscape. From
the vibrant major key melodies to the soulful minor key harmonies, the
histograms reveal a diverse but discernible preference for certain
tonalities, reflecting the unique artistry and emotional landscapes of
the club members. The ubiquitous 4/4 time signature across the playlists
speaks to a shared structural foundation, a rhythmic heartbeat that is
both grounding and universally accessible.</p>
<p>Through the heatmaps and self-similarity matrices, the study uncovers
unexpected sonic kinship, such as the parallel between the energetic
crescendos of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and the soulful grooves of
“Valerie.” These surprising affiliations underscore the universal
qualities of music that cross genre boundaries, suggesting a deeper
level of artistic and emotional resonance.</p>
<p>The Fourier-based tempograms and tempo analyses challenge our
perception of musical pace, revealing the complexities of rhythm and how
it is perceived, potentially contrasting the analytical data with the
human experience of the music. Such disparities invite a contemplation
on the nature of musical interpretation—algorithmic versus
experiential.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the members of “The 27 Club,” through their diverse
and groundbreaking contributions, demonstrate the myriad ways in which
music can be constructed, perceived, and appreciated. While their
careers were marked by individual struggles and their lives poignantly
brief, the enduring influence of their music is a testament to their
exceptional talents. This study not only celebrates their legacies but
also contributes to a deeper understanding of their artistic
expressions, capturing the eternal echoes of their voices in the world
of music.</p>
<p>In the end, “The 27 Club” is not solely defined by loss but
illuminated by the indelible impact of its members, whose musical echoes
continue to resonate through the ages, challenging, inspiring, and
redefining the contours of musical expression.</p>
